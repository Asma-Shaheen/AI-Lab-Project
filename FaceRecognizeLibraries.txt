----Libraries for face recognition

NumPy: Numpy stands for Numerical Python. NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, 
       fourier transform, and matrices.

Cmake: CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles 
       and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice.

dlib: DLib is an open source library implementing a variety of machine learning algorithms, including classification, regression, clustering, data transformation, 
      and structured prediction.

FaceRecognition: Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with the world’s simplest face recognition library.Built using dlib’s 
                 state-of-the-art face recognition.

opencv-contrib-python: OpenCV (open source computer vision) is a very powerful library for image processing and machine learning tasks which also supports Tensorflow, 
                       Torch/Pytorch and Caffe.
